        p.text-muted After being captivated by my own pregnancy, childbirth and subsequent transition into motherhood, I felt deeply drawn to assure other birthing mothers unconditional support throughout their own childbirth experiences. In my journey toward becoming a Doula I have come to believe that a woman who has been well cared for during her pregnancy, labor and childbirth (whose desires have been listened to and whose physical sensations and emotions affirmed) is in turn, better prepared to care for and nurture her child(ren). 
        p.text-muted A Midwestern girl all my life, I graduated with my Master’s in Social Work and Mental Health from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. After the birth of my son in 2016, a new passion for birth and supporting birthing women convinced me to direct the knowledge gained from my previous educational pursuits into what I hope will be a long career of providing education and reliable support to families in perhaps the greatest transition of their lives…that of welcoming new life!
